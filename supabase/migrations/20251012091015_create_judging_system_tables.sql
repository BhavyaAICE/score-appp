  # Judging System Database Schema

  ## Overview
  This migration creates the core database tables for a comprehensive event judging system.
  It enables persistent storage of events, judges, teams, scoring criteria, and evaluation scores,
  replacing localStorage with a robust database solution.

  ## New Tables
  
  ### `events`
  Stores event information and configuration
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique event identifier
  - `name` (text) - Event name
  - `description` (text) - Event description
  - `start_date` (timestamptz) - Event start date/time
  - `end_date` (timestamptz) - Event end date/time
  - `status` (text) - Event status (draft, active, completed)
  - `created_by` (uuid) - User who created the event
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Creation timestamp
  - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - Last update timestamp

  ### `judges`
  Stores judge information and access tokens
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique judge identifier
  - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Associated event
  - `name` (text) - Judge name
  - `email` (text) - Judge email address
  - `category` (text) - Judge category (Software/Hardware)
  - `token` (text, unique) - Access token for judge dashboard
  - `invitation_sent` (boolean) - Whether invitation email was sent
  - `invitation_sent_at` (timestamptz) - When invitation was sent
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Creation timestamp

  ### `teams`
  Stores team information
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique team identifier
  - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Associated event
  - `name` (text) - Team name
  - `category_id` (text) - Team category (Software/Hardware)
  - `project_title` (text) - Project title
  - `project_description` (text) - Project description
  - `members` (jsonb) - Array of team member information
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Creation timestamp

  ### `criteria`
  Stores scoring criteria for events
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique criterion identifier
  - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Associated event
  - `name` (text) - Criterion name
  - `description` (text) - Criterion description
  - `weight` (numeric) - Weight/multiplier for scoring
  - `max_score` (numeric) - Maximum possible score
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Creation timestamp

  ### `judge_team_assignments`
  Maps judges to their assigned teams
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique assignment identifier
  - `judge_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Judge reference
  - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Team reference
  - `assigned_at` (timestamptz) - Assignment timestamp

  ### `scores`
  Stores individual scores from judges
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique score identifier
  - `judge_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Judge who submitted score
  - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key) - Team being scored
  - `criterion_key` (text) - Criterion being scored (innovation, execution, etc)
  - `score` (numeric) - Score value
  - `round` (integer) - Round number
  - `submitted_at` (timestamptz) - Submission timestamp

  ## Security
  - Enable RLS on all tables
  - Add policies for authenticated admin users to manage events
  - Add policies for judges to access their assignments via token
  - Public read access for results (can be restricted later)

  ## Important Notes
  1. All tables use UUIDs for primary keys with automatic generation
  2. Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
  3. Timestamps track creation and modification
  4. RLS policies are restrictive by default

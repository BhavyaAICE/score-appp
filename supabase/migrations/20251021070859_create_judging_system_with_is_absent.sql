  # Create Complete Judging System Database Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `events` - Store event information
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text, required)
      - `description` (text)
      - `start_date`, `end_date` (timestamptz)
      - `status` (text, enum: draft/active/completed)
      - `created_by` (uuid)
      - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamptz)
    
    - `judges` - Store judge information
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key to events)
      - `name`, `email` (text, required)
      - `category` (text, enum: Software/Hardware)
      - `token` (text, unique - for authentication)
      - `invitation_sent` (boolean)
      - `invitation_sent_at`, `created_at` (timestamptz)
    
    - `teams` - Store team/participant information
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key to events)
      - `name` (text, required)
      - `category_id` (text, enum: software/hardware)
      - `project_title`, `project_description` (text)
      - `members` (jsonb, array of team members)
      - `is_absent` (boolean, default false)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
    
    - `criteria` - Store judging criteria
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `event_id` (uuid, foreign key to events)
      - `name` (text, required)
      - `description` (text)
      - `weight` (numeric, default 1)
      - `max_score` (numeric, default 10)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
    
    - `judge_team_assignments` - Link judges to teams
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `judge_id` (uuid, foreign key to judges)
      - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key to teams)
      - `assigned_at` (timestamptz)
      - Unique constraint on (judge_id, team_id)
    
    - `scores` - Store judge scores for teams
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `judge_id` (uuid, foreign key to judges)
      - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key to teams)
      - `criterion_key` (text)
      - `score` (numeric, 0-10 range)
      - `round` (integer, default 1)
      - `submitted_at` (timestamptz)
      - Unique constraint on (judge_id, team_id, criterion_key, round)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for authenticated users to manage events, judges, teams, criteria, and assignments
    - Add policies allowing anyone to view and create scores (for judge token-based access)
    
  3. Performance
    - Create indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
    - Index on judges.token for quick token lookups

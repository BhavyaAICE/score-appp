# 🎯 EvelutorApp — Fair & Transparent Judging Platform

> A modern web platform for managing multi-round evaluation events like hackathons, idea pitches, and innovation challenges — with built-in bias correction and real-time results.

---

## 🌟 Overview

**EvelutorApp** streamlines event evaluation from setup to final results.  
Admins can create events, assign judges, manage rounds, and automatically normalize scores to ensure fairness — eliminating judge bias using **Z-score normalization**.

This project aims to make competition scoring **transparent**, **data-driven**, and **simple**.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 👩‍💼 Admin Portal
- Create and configure events, rounds, venues, and categories  
- Define weighted scoring categories (e.g., *Innovation*, *Technical*, *Presentation*)  
- Manage teams, judges, and assignments  
- Trigger computations: **Top-N selection**, **Normalization**, **Final Rankings**  
- Export results (CSV/PDF)  
- View and override scores with full audit trail  

### 🧑‍⚖️ Judge Interfaces
- Simple, distraction-free scoring form  
- Enter category scores via secure tokenized links (no login hassle)  
- Auto-calculated totals and validation  

### 📊 Results & Fairness Engine
- Judge-wise **Z-score normalization** to remove leniency/harshness bias  
- Percentile-based ranking for final results  
- Multi-round progression (Round 1 → Round 2 finalists)  
- Supports manual edits, audit logging, and data exports

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🧮 Scoring Pipeline

1. **Raw Totals** → judges rate teams across categories  
2. **Z-score Normalization** → adjusts for judge bias  
3. **Aggregation** → team mean Z computed across judges  
4. **Percentile Mapping** → converts to fair, intuitive scores  
5. **Ranking** → final team order is derived

This ensures results reflect *relative performance*, not judge variability.

## 🧠 Normalization Logic (Z-Score)

The platform uses a robust **Per-Criterion Z-Score** algorithm to ensure fairness:

1.  **Calculate Z-Score per Criterion**:
    For each criterion $c$, judge $j$, and team $i$:
    $$Z_{i,j,c} = \frac{X_{i,j,c} - \mu_{j,c}}{\sigma_{j,c}}$$
    *(Where $X$ is the raw score, $\mu$ is the judge's mean for that criterion, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation)*

2.  **Apply Weighting**:
    $$Z_{weighted} = Z_{i,j,c} \times Weight_c$$

3.  **Aggregation**:
    Team's final score is the **sum** of all weighted Z-scores from all judges.
    $$FinalScore_i = \sum_{j} \sum_{c} (Z_{i,j,c} \times Weight_c)$$

4.  **Ranking**:
    Teams are ranked by their final aggregated Z-Score. Ties are broken by:
    1. Score on highest weighted criterion.
    2. Score on next highest weighted criterion.
    3. Mean raw total.
